# NoSlouchBench

NoSlouchBench is a reproducible benchmarking framework for evaluating posture detection pipelines built on top of MediaPipe, YOLO-Pose, OpenPose, and similar pose estimation backbones.

It standardizes:
- Dataset splits
- Posture classification logic
- Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, robustness, and inference latency

The goal is fair, deployment-aware comparison of real-time posture detection systems.
